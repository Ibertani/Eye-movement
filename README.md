# Eyes 
  This code animates a pair of eyes to follow a mouse moving around the screen. The eyes are divs positioned relative to eachother and are animated using the event mouse move, it also uses the properties clientx and clienty which are the mouse coordinates on the screen. In the future I would change the shape of the eyes and give them eyebrows.
